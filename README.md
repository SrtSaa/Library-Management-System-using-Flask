# Library-Management-with-Flask
Library Management Website With Flask


Here **SQLite** database is used for simplicity.

Please visit the "admin_member_files" directory.
Here four files are present.

-- student.txt contains all the registered students of the institute.

-- faculty.txt holds all the registered faculties of the institute.

-- Details of the admin of the portal are conferred at admin.txt.

-- All the registered members are given in member.txt.

Note, only a valid student or faculty of an institue can only be a library member. And there is no option to register an new admin as only an administrator can decide who could be an admin.

For the better view of these text files, please set indent size as 4.
